# text-mininmination

The examination has two parts:

- A text file with questions to answer: questions.txt
- A coding exercise in a Python file: text_mining_exam.py

The coding exercise comes with a companion test suite.

To coding exercise will be evaluated on the following critera in that
order:

- the correctness of the code (in particular how many tests pass);
- the clarity of the code (simplicity and good choice of variable names);
- the respect of the code conventions (e.g. check with flake8).

To run the tests, first make sure that you install this project folder
in your `tmclass` conda environment using Anaconda prompt.

    conda activate tmclass
        cd text-mining-exam

	Then use pytest to run the tests:

	    python -m pytest -v

	    To check the code conventions:

	        python -m flake8 text_mining_exam.py
